## About Me

I build scalable applications that (usually) don’t break in production.  
When they do, I fix them fast - and redesign them so they don’t break again.

I focus on transforming complex problems into clean, maintainable systems using strong architectural principles and modern tooling.

---

## What I Care About

- Designing systems that scale beyond “it works on my machine”
- Writing clean architecture instead of spaghetti architecture
- Building real-time systems that are actually real-time
- Integrating AI in practical, production-ready ways
- Shipping systems built for long-term maintainability
